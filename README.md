# eduPLEX

This is the code repository for the eduPLEX website, which hosts videos, articles, and sample problems for AP Computer Science.

## About

Inspired by Sal Khan and Khan Academy, eduPLEX began as a way to provide educational resources for topics in high school AP courses that were not already available online. Currently, eduPLEX is creating content for AP Computer Science A and AP Computer Science Principles, with plans of expanding to cover additional courses in the near future. We hope that our videos will promote an intuitive, self-paced pursuit into the realm of computer science and higher learning for students anywhere in the world.
